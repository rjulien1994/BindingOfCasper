This is a JavaScript mini game storing in game data in a mySQL db

The game is currently not finished as I am still hoping to add a monster or two and I am still working on only uploading non empty query to the mySQL db.

To create the db you need to load mySQL, create your database for the mysql shell command and then either create the tables from the shell or use popSQL/code editor.
